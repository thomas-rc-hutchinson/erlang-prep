length([1]).

63> erlang:element(2,{a,b,c}).

Macros
 -define(MACRO, some_value). and is used as ?MACRO inside any function 
 -define(sub(X,Y), X-Y). and used like ?sub(23,47), later replaced by 23-47 by the compiler 

Modules
- module_info/0, module_info/1

Trivia
- .erl files compiled down to .beam (Bogdan/Bj√∂rn's Erlang Abstract Machine)files
- c/1 is used to compile, cd/1 to change dir
- Can be compiled to native code
- vsn is an automatically generated unique value differentiating each version of your code. It is used in code hot-loading (upgrading an application while it runs, without stopping it) and by some tools related to release handling.
- Open Telecom Platform is the open source distribution of Erlang and an application server written in Erlang
- Guard clause ; acts like orelse and evaluates one. , just evaluates first.
- is_integer, is_list etc are built in functions
