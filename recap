Macros
 -define(MACRO, some_value). and is used as ?MACRO inside any function 
 -define(sub(X,Y), X-Y). and used like ?sub(23,47), later replaced by 23-47 by the compiler 

Modules
- module_info/0, module_info/1

Trivia
- .erl files compiled down to .beam (Bogdan/Bj√∂rn's Erlang Abstract Machine)files
- c/1 is used to compile, cd/1 to change dir
- Can be compiled to native code
- vsn is an automatically generated unique value differentiating each version of your code. It is used in code hot-loading (upgrading an application while it runs, without stopping it) and by some tools related to release handling.
- Open Telecom Platform is the open source distribution of Erlang and an application server written in Erlang
- Guard clause ; acts like orelse and evaluates one. , just evaluates first.
- is_integer, is_list etc are built in functions
- Version 17.5[1] / April 1, 2015; 
- When it didn't work, an error was thrown in your face, but only once you ran the code. This is because Erlang is dynamically typed: every error is caught at runtime and the compiler won't always yell at you when compiling modules where things may result in failure, like in Starting Out (for real)'s "llama + 5" example.
- The best example is the often reported nine nines (99.9999999%) of availability offered on the Ericsson AXD 301 ATM switches, 
- Erlang is also strongly typed e.g. 6 + "1" fails.
- Erlang header files are pretty similar to their C counter-part: they're nothing but a snippet of code that gets added to the module as if it were written there in the first place. Create a file named records.hrl with the following content
